    "## Project Overview\n",
    "Real-time 3D pose estimation and semantic analysis system for human movement analysis using multiple synchronized cameras. This project evolved from foundational planning (Meeting 1: Trevor & Jason, ~Sept 5) to implementation refinement (Meeting 2: Trevor, Jason & Henry, ~Sept 6-7, 2025).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Applications:\n",
    "- **Combat Sports**: Kickboxing analysis (jabs, crosses, hooks, kicks) with multi-person scenarios\n",
    "- **Dance Performance**: Pose-to-sound mapping for immersive art installations (Wei Dong collaboration)\n",
    "- **Medical/Recovery**: Gait analysis for concussion recovery tracking\n",
    "- **Fitness**: Kettlebell exercise form analysis and technique correction\n",
    "- **General Motion Capture**: Extensible framework for various movement analysis scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "**Demo Target**: September 24, 2025 in San Francisco with Wei Dong (Kineve/Kinetech Arts)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Evolution & Meeting Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "### Meeting 1 (Foundational Architecture, ~2 hours)\n",
    "**Participants**: Trevor Conger (intern/student) & Jason (mentor/lead with IoT/sensors background)\n",
    "**Focus**: Deep-dive architectural planning with educational emphasis\n",
    "- Established pipeline blueprint: Capture â†’ Normalize â†’ Fuse â†’ Model â†’ Semantics\n",
    "- Defined real-time as SLA (Service Level Agreement) with emergency response analogies\n",
    "- Explored graph-based approach with explicit edges (wrist-elbow connections)\n",
    "- Emphasized mentorship and foundational understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "### Meeting 2 (Implementation Pivot, ~30-60 mins with tech issues)\n",
    "**Participants**: Trevor, Jason & Henry (Trevor's classmate, 3D modeling expertise)\n",
    "**Focus**: Tactical implementation with collaborative problem-solving\n",
    "- **Key Shift**: From graph-based to point cloud approach (no explicit edges)\n",
    "- Introduced OFF format and ModelNet integration strategy\n",
    "- Added Henry's 3D mesh experience (Minecraft replicas, mesh simplification)\n",
    "- Refined tools and setup procedures\n",
    "\n",
    "## Technical Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Input Capture & Synchronization\n",
    "- **Hardware**: 3 synchronized cameras (Raspberry Pi cameras: 640x480, 240 FPS)\n",
    "- **Synchronization Method**: Hollywood-style light-flash technique (hacky but effective)\n",
    "- **Processing**: MediaPipe for pose estimation\n",
    "  - Outputs 33 keypoints per frame per camera\n",
    "  - Each keypoint has XYZ coordinates (99 columns total: 33 Ã— 3)\n",
    "  - Confidence scores available but ignored initially\n",
    "- **Data Source**: KB_snatch_Sept5_prim folder (3 Parquet/CSV files from kettlebell footage)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Data Pipeline & Storage\n",
    "- **Input Format**: CSV/Parquet files (3 files per session, one per camera)\n",
    "- **Data Structure**: High frame rate (240 FPS) provides density; can downsample to 30 FPS\n",
    "- **Database**: KDB (column-based time series with in-memory capabilities)\n",
    "- **File Management**: GitHub for code, DVC for data versioning, UV for package management\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Normalization & Fusion Strategy\n",
    "- **Reference Frame**: MediaPipe provides world coordinates (standard reference frame)\n",
    "- **Fusion Method**: For each frame and keypoint, combine XYZ from all 3 cameras\n",
    "  - Creates triangular mesh or point set per keypoint\n",
    "  - Results in sparse point cloud per frame (99 points total)\n",
    "- **Alternative Approach**: Point cloud concatenation without explicit edge collapse\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Data Transformation for ML\n",
    "- **Target Format**: OFF (Object File Format) for compatibility with ModelNet\n",
    "- **OFF Structure**:\n",
    "  - Header: \"OFF\"\n",
    "  - Counts: vertices (99), faces, edges (0)\n",
    "  - Vertex list: XYZ coordinates per line\n",
    "  - Face list: Triangles defined by 3-camera views per keypoint\n",
    "- **Implementation**: Hack ModelNet class to use local OFF files instead of downloads\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Machine Learning Framework\n",
    "- **Primary Framework**: PyTorch Geometric\n",
    "- **Model Architecture**: PointNet/PointNet++ for point cloud processing\n",
    "  - **Evolution**: Shifted from graph-based (Meeting 1) to point cloud focus (Meeting 2)\n",
    "  - Handles sparse point clouds without explicit edges\n",
    "  - Uses distance functions for associations instead of predefined connections\n",
    "- **Reference Implementation**: Weights & Biases PointNet example for architecture guidance\n",
    "- **Data Classes**: Data/TemporalData for graph representation\n",
    "- **Logging**: MLflow (preferred over Weights & Biases for cost/market relevance)\n",
    "- **Scaling**: PyTorch Geometric auto-scales to multi-GPU (PaperSpace for cloud development)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Real-Time Processing Definition\n",
    "- **Real-Time = SLA**: Service Level Agreement guaranteeing response within time window\n",
    "- **Not**: Ultra-low latency, but predictable throughput\n",
    "- **Target**: Based on input volume and processing needs\n",
    "- **Hardware Scaling**: PyTorch Geometric auto-scales to multi-GPU\n",
    "\n",
